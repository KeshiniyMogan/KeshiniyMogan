Hi guys! I'm Keshiniy Mogan from Penang. Currently, a 4th-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science, majoring in Bioinformatics at the University Technology Malaysia (UTM). My academic goal is to graduate with the first honour of a degree and complete my education with a PhD. I'm a drive-to-achieve person who is always looking for new things to learn and adapt.
